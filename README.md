## Why this document?

Doing well in a laboratory requires some knowledge. While we often think first of necessary technical and scientific knowledge, it is also necessary to acquire "soft" knowledge, that encompasses a lot of things from knowing how to contact IT services, to knowing where PBS is stored. Part of this knowledge is laboratory dependent, part of this knowledge is invariant from one laboratory to the other.

This document, in constant evolution, is an attempt at gathering such information in a single file that you can go back to. It is also a way for me not to forget details that could be essential to you.

The document is organized in two parts. The first part deals with what is invariant between laboratories. The second part deals with information that is specific to our lab, here in Basel.

## Working in a laboratory: invariant principles

The following list, which is not exhaustive, sums up important principles that should be followed in a scientific laboratory.

1- **Ask questions, to others but also to yourself**

In the very beginning of the internship, you will be communicated a lot of new information. But information is only valuable if you have enough of it! Let's say you look for erlenmeyers. If my answer is that they are in the big cupboard and that you do not know where the big cupboard is, needless to say that my answer alone is not very valuable. To make information valuable you sometimes need more information. And to get more information you need and you are even expected to ask questions. And usually, the sooner you ask a question, the better.

Importantly, it is also good practice to ask questions to yourself:
- Do I understand what I am being told or explained? If you do not know the answer to that question, don't hesitate to ask.
- What am I doing now? Why for? What's the point? Again, if you cannot figure it out, if something is bugging you, ask.

As a trainee, you might think that not understanding something is your fault. But it takes two to dance a tango. Clear communication is the responsability of both emitter and receiver. So ask.

Finally, you are in the trainee position, and you main objective is to learn. So ask. Asking around is also an opportunity to get an idea of the diversity of projects, techniques and approaches that exist within the lab and beyond. Use that opportunity.

2- **Plan and then do, not the contrary. But if you do, note it down.**

Planning an experiment starts with asking yourself the following: "What is the question I want to answer?". 

Once a good question has been set, you can start planning an experiment. It seems to be common sense, it is often overlooked.

Once your protocol has been written, think about what could be the outcomes. Are these outcomes answering your question? What could explain these outcomes?

At this point, it is important to mention of **negative and positive controls**, that you should use to assess the relevance of an experimental result.

As a general rule, you can remember the following:

- **A positive result, is relevant if the corresponding negative control is itself negative.**
  - e.g: I have 100 colonies on a petri dish after my cloning. If my negative control (ligation product without the insert) plate, shows 100 colonies, what can I say? And if I have only 1 colony on my negative control plate?
- **A negative result, is relevant if the corresponding positive result is itself positive.**
  - e.g: I grow an E. coli exotic strain in an exotic liquid culture. After a few days, nothing shows in the flask. Let's say I have a positive control flask that contains a culture medium where this E. coli strain is known to grow well. What can I say about my exotic  culture medium if the positive control shows nothing? What can I say if the contrary happens?

The outcome of this process is the protocol, that should be printed or written, in a way that it is understandable to others. Having it already printed out or written is quite useful, as you can annotate it while doing the experiment. This is important because, while doing the experiment, you will figure out things that needs to be changed the next time you do it (the same experiments is almost always conducted several times!), or you will figure out/decide deviations from the actual protocol.

Changing the protocol is sometimes necessary. **But not writting what you did, and how you changed the protocol is not allowed.**

3- **Honesty in science, to yourself and others**

We all do mistakes. This is completely alright. What is not alright is to try to hide it. In the best case your mistake is only impacting you. But in most cases, it will impact others as well, as we are all sharing the same experimental setups and working conditions.

Also, keep in mind that "mistakes" are a valuable source of information! A well tracked mistake (see above!) can be highly valuable! An untracked/hidden mistake, is inevitably a complete waste of time.

So document your mistakes as well!

4- **Did I forget anything?**

10 minutes before leaving the lab, ask yourself that question. Is everything that should be turned off, actually turned off? Are all my samples back in the freezer? Did I put my culture in the incubator?

This is a healthy routine that can save you a lot of time.

5- **Clean up after yourself**

In general, experimental setups and benches should be in the same state before and after you worked on them. This rule is extremely important for shared ressources and common space!

5- **Capitalize experience (i.e be gentle to your future self)**

There is motto that I like (even though I have a hard time applying to myself), which is: "Someone else should not have to teach/tell me the same thing twice".

So take notes, and come up with a system to keep your notes tidied. In the future you should be able to find back these notes if needed, and hence you make your future self happy and grateful, thanks to this capitalized experience. The better you are at doing so, the more autonomous and self-confident you will feel and be.

6- **Read**

Good ideas are never coming out of the blue. Science is built at the border between what is known and what is not known... so you need to know what's already known!

There are no miracles. You need to read/attend seminars to acquire this knowledge. So take the time to read. It is better to understand well 10 seminal papers, than to approximately know 1000 of them.

Some resources are usually better than others when starting in a new field: text books and reviews are usually the place to start! Ask around.

7- **Put things in context**

This is a very important point. Whether you are doing science or not, you will always have to explain what you are doing to others. Always ask yourself: "Who am I talking to? What is this person's background? How can I present things in the way it is going to be the clearest and most efficient to them". If you do not know, ask! As a rule of thumb, too much context is always much better than not enough (ask if you can speed up!). And even if people are supposed to know what you are talking about, they might have forgotten. Reexplain if necessary.

8- **Write**

Whether you are doing science or not, you will be asked to write reports. The only way to learn how to do this is to write, write and write again. Do not miss the opportunities.

9- **Learn to present your results well**

A major part of science is about communicating what you are doing to others. There are some rules to the making of good presentations.

## Working you way in our lab

Welcome to the laboratory!
Here is what you should know about the lab in general.

### General consideration about our science

As you might already know, our laboratory adresses experimental and computational questions related to the regulation of gene expression in bacteria. More generally, our laboratory, is interested in fundamental open questions. Let me explain what I mean by "fundamental open questions". Science is about setting up questions, and trying to answer them. But in science, contrary to an "exercise", the answer is not known in advance, that's what I call "open questions". By fundamental, I mean that our goal is to generate knowledge. Sometimes this knowledge can be turned into a technology. Sometimes it simply advances our understanding of biology.

You might think that these open questions drive experiments. This is true, and this is called "hypothesis driven" research. But sometimes, these questions precede experimental observations: you first do experiments, generate data and start asking questions about them. This is called "data driven" research.
  
You should know that our lab works in both ways. Which can be unsettling, as sometimes, the question behind an experiment is not clear yet, as we just want to "see" what happens. And this is why the principle #1 is extremely important.

What follows are practical considerations.

### Notes/Recording/Monitoring lab work

Lab work is organized in projects (that can be porous).

The core of lab work consists of:
  - Finding good questions. Output = scientific question
  - Planning experiments. Output = protocol
  - Making experiments. Output = data, samples
  - Analyzing experimental results. Output = figures mainly
  - Reporting about scientific results. Output = reports, publications

Lab activity gives birth to many items of very different nature. These things need to be organized.  Here are my two cents about how I think it should be organized. As you will see, this revolves around experiments.

### Organisation proposal

Let's imagine we are in the project "Project".

When an experiment is to be performed, a new directory is created on the cluster:
Project>experiments>Project_date_description(oneWord)_index

**Example:**
constitexpr_exp_20200114_cloning_001

This folder should include the following:
- 20200114_protocol (markdown document)
- raw data generated by the experiment
- all necessary files to redo the experiment

If analysis is to be performed, another folder is created:
Project>analysis_and_reports>Project_analysis_date_description(oneWord)_index
Project>analysis_and_reports>Project_report_date_description(oneWord)_index

**Example:**
constit_analysis_20200116_cloningResuls_001
Such folder should contain the following folders
data: data necessary for the analysis (except raw data which are stored in experiments)
src: containing scripts to run the analysis/report
The report itself: constit_analysis_20200116_cloningResuls_001.pdf
Obviously the report should refer to the protocol and to the experiment folder.

**important: it is better generally to refer to full path when referring to raw data files in the analysis**

Presentations can be kept in:
Project>presentations

And finally I usually keep a "todo" and a "log file", to keep track of everything I am doing in a project. Every entry in this log file is preceded by the date.

### About your notes

Keep in mind that your notes should respect the following:

1- **Readable**

Your notes should be stored in a file format that's as simple as possible so as to be readable by anyone. I recommend using markdown documents [Markdown (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (text file where markdown syntax is being used).

But you can use open office for instance, or another word - like document type.

A routine to back-up these notes must also be implemented. Repositories, or university cluster can be used to do so.

2- **Understandable**

What is written in your notes should be understandable by anybody (and most importantly, the "future you"). Write plain sentences. 

3- **Self-Supporting**

A document is never written out of the blue. It is issued in a context. Are they notes written during a course? Then, the name, the date of the course should be written.

Is this an experimental report? Then it should be linked to a protocol.

4- **Exhaustive**

If you describe experiments, you and others should be able to reproduce them. Do not omit critical details.

### Computer related stuff

#### Operating systems

All operating systems are allowed in the laboratory. But if I were you I would go for Ubuntu (PC) or OSX (Mac). There are UNIX systems, and we use the UNIX terminal a lot in the laboratory. But this is not only about us: UNIX shell is extremely powerful. Your computer is a machine that's meant to be "programmed" and used to "automate" tasks. It is not meant to be powered by the mouse movement like a windmill.

In the course of your internship, you might analyze some of your data, and you will have to use shell commands and shell scripting. If needs be, you'll be taught the basics. You can also look for some tutorials online (or ask us, we'll be happy to point you towards useful ressources).

#### Programming languages

The main programming languages that are used in the laboratory are Python and R. R is mostly used for data analysis. Again, if you do some data analysis, you will be invited to use it to analyze your data. Regarding this, you can refer to the following book: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

#### Regular expressions

We use them a lot in the laboratory. You'll maybe learn a bit about them. [Regular expressions (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). 

## Lab organization

### Group meetings

Currently, group meeting take place every Thursday from 3 to 5 pm.

## Mini-group meetings

Besides group meeting, we also meet for mini-group meeting, where people leading projects are expected to briefly present what they are currently doing. They happen every Tuesday morning.
